    <h2>xSwipe</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the support offered at hardware and driver level, Linux lacks of a gesture handling system for trackpads. Gestures with two/three
      (or more) fingers can drastically increase the user experience and the productivity. xSwipe was born with the aim of handling gestures on
      the top of other trackpad gestures already implemented and working, such as natural scrolling.
      I re-wrote the original (Perl) project in Ruby, trying to make it more maintainable and adaptable to different back-ends.<br/>

    <h2>EyeSleep</h2>
    <p>
      Working with computers could be harmful! Constantly staring at the screen for hours can be stressful for the eyes. Eyesleep is a not-intrusive
      program which helps the user to apply the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something else (about 20 feet far) for 20 seconds.
      Eyesleep can be stopped at any time (even though it is not good for eyes!) and users can temporarly delay the 20 seconds pause.
